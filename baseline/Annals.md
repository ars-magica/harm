        + *Aedan MacCloud, an Irish lord, appears with his daughter, Deirdre, who is also betrothed to Joseph.

They also bring two guards. Aedan's holdings are in the North of Ireland.*
        + *Cieran is left mediating between the two groups.  Aedan has been rebaptised and borrowed £300 from the church, something which binds him to arrange a church marriage for his daughter.
