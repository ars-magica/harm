## Spring 1255

+ Elk's Run
    + Joseph's fiancé (SQ 8)
        + Joseph ex Miscellanea of Lambaird visits with his wife, Rhianna, and his brother Jacob, who is a horse trader.  They are fraternal twins. Joseph has been instrumental to healing the rift between Vigil and Lambaird.  It is not the first time they visit Elk's Run after the agreements of resiprocal reading hospitality were made.
        + Aedan MacCloud, an Irish lord, appears with his daughter, Deirdre, who is also betrothed to Joseph. It turns out that he has about eight wives, under old Brehon Law, often with faerie blessing. Aedan brother, a parish priest known as father Clint, is also part of the entourage.  They also bring two guards. Aedan's holdings are in the North of Ireland.
        + Cieran is left mediating between the two groups.  Aedan has been rebaptised and borrowed £300 from the church, something which binds him to arrange a church marriage for his daughter. The betrothal was sealed before his rebaptism, in a faerie ceremony. It seems that the faeries involved are quite powerful. Faerie blood also runs in the family, and strongly so with Deirdre.
        + Joseph's polygamy was the idea of his first wife, Criodne, a maga, who had started her longevity ritual.  She wanted Joseph to have more children before his longevity ritual.
        + Cieran have them see that both parties have been less than honest and entered incompatible bargains. In the end, he arranges for Elk's Run to lend Aedan the money to cover half his dept to the church, with Joseph to have Vigil cover the other half, so that Aedan can embrace the faerie and Brehon ways.
        + Trade three Creo tractatus to receive three Imaginem Tractatus (Q2/Q9/Q8), as proposed by Rhianna.
        + One confidence point per character taking part.

The horse was chased by three dark fey, a rabbit, a ram, and a wolf.  They meet a magic owl in a tree with an ancient hole, saying that the hole was made by the horn of a unicorn who since lost the horn to someone who made it into a weapon.  On the second visit, the tree is gone.  Tiou and Sean recover the horn from a mound which also contains an Hermetic sanctum.  Eogan stays out of the mound, for fear of the magi's dangers.  The aura there is faerie.
    + Eogan brings: horse, spear, bow, four hunting dogs, standard grog pack.
