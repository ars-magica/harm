    + The Unicorn (SQ10 + Independent Study).  Eogan was approached by a man from a village half a day away, needing help with a wild horse with wounds that would not heal.  The horse was chased by three dark fey, a rabbit, a ram, and a wolf.  They meet a magic owl in a tree with an ancient hole, saying that the hole was made by the horn of a unicorn who since lost the horn to someone who made it into a weapon.  On the second visit, the tree is gone.  Tiou and Sean recover the horn from a mound which also contains an Hermetic sanctum.  Eogan stays out of the mound, for fear of the magi's dangers.  The aura there is faerie.
