## Grimoire

+ *Improved Purification of the Festering Wounds* CrCo25 (32)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Moon; Target: Ind
    + The target gains a +12 bonus to Recovery rolls to recover from injuries or diseases, as long as he has been under the influence of this spell for the whole of the recovery interval. The recovery interval is counted from the time that the spell is cast; any previous time is ignored.
    + Base 5, +1 Touch, +3 Moon
    + Custom variant [ArM5:129]
+ *Restoration of the Defiled Body* CrCo25 (32)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind; Ritual
    + Removes the crippling or malignant aftereffects of any injury, poison, or disease, or of premature aging. The effects of natural aging cannot be undone by this or any spell. This spell does not heal wounds, only extra effects.
    + Base 20, +1 Touch
    + [ArM5:129]
+ *Gift of Quickness (personal range)* CrCo30 (32)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Safe Casting

    + Base 30
    + Custom variant

    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + The target takes a heavy wound
    + Base 15, touch +1
    + Custom
+ *Spasms of the Uncontrolled Body* ReCo5 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Ind
    + One of the target’s hands spasms, causing him to drop anything he is holding in it. It keeps spasming for as long as you concentrate.
    + Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun
    + Custom [ArM:134]
+ *Gift of the Frog's Legs* ReCo15 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Still Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + Allows the target to leap up to 15 feet vertically or 25 feet horizontally (2 feet less for every Encumbrance point). The person must make a Dexterity – Encumbrance stress roll of 0+ to land without injury. A miss indicates that he takes a Light Wound, and a botch indicates a Medium Wound. The target can only leap once for each casting of the spell, and that leap must be made within ten seconds. As with a frog’s leap, a running start does not improve the leap.
    + Base 10, +1 Touch
    + [ArM5:134]
+ *Leap of Homecoming* ReCo35 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Still Casting
    + Range: Per; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + Transports you to any place to which you have an Arcane Connection. Most magi use this to return to their laboratories.
    + Base 35

    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Still Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + Transports the target to any place to which you have an Arcane Connection.
    + Base 35 +1 Touch
    + Custom
+ *Converse with Plant and Tree* InHe25 (24)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Conc; Target: Ind
    + You can speak with a plant for one conversation. The level of conversation depends on the type of plants; longer-lived and more noble plants have more to say. A single question and response takes ten to thirty minutes, with slower-growing plants speaking more slowly. Typically, plants can talk about the soil and about other plants around them, but have limited awareness of more momentary events, such as the passing of animals or people, unless that passing has a direct bearing on the plant (for example, a person cut its trunk). News can spread quickly through a forest when it has to, called from tree to tree on the wind. Bystanders cannot understand your conversation.
    + Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration
    + [ArM5:136]
+ *Lamp till Morning without Flame* CrIg15 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Still Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Ind
    + This spell creates a steady light as bright as daylight on a cloudy day. The light has no apparent source, but illuminates an area about ten paces across, centered on a point indicated by the caster. This point may be a mobile item.
    + Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun
    + Custom Variant [ArM:140]
+ *Arrow of Fiery Ribbons* CrIg30 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Group
    + Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group
    + Variant of Arc of the Fiery Ribbons [ArM5:140]
+ *Ward against Heat and Flames* ReIg25 (26)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Fast Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Ind
    + Keeps heat and fire at bay, unable to approach within 1 pace of the target. This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of molten iron. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire doing less than +15 damage per round doesn’t penetrate the ward. Such fires simply dim at the protected person’s passing and flare back up after he or she is gone.
    + Base 4, +2 for up to +15 damage, +1 Touch, +2 Sun
    + [ArM5:143]
+ *False Window* CrIm5 (46)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Ind
    + This spell allows the magus to trace the frame of a door or window and create a miniature that seems to show something that lies beyond the frame. A Perception + Finesse roll is required to craft a convincing illusion. The Ease Factor is 9 if the image seems to show a room, 12 if it seems to show a structure, or 15 if it seems to run to the horizon. These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.  Many casters of False Window add an additional magnitude, so that figures within the image appear to move, and the pattern of light changes to suit the time of day, but this simpler version creates only a static image. This spell also models similar spells for the other senses: a mirror that plays a tune, provided its face is not turned toward a wall, is an example. Directly created species like these are resisted by the Parma Magica.
    + Base 2, +2 Sun or Ring, +1 Individual
    + [HoH:S:68]
+ *Smoke of Escaping* CrIm5 (46)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Diam; Target: Ind
    + Creates the illusion of a thick cloud of red smoke in the caster’s vicinity.
    + Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +1 size, +1 impenetrable to sight
    + [MoH:124]
+ *Clarity of Public Speech* CrIm10 (46)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Room
+ *Horror Cabinet* CrIm35 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Req. Re
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Moon; Target: Room
    + Fills the room with horrible, moving images of beasts, ghosts, and undead threatening to devour any intruders.  Most will run in panic (failing a brave personality roll 12+), and some (botching such roll) may be driven insane.
    + Base 3 (three senses) + Touch + Moon +Room -> L25 +1 (Rego) +1 (Complexity) -> L35
+ *Prying Eyes* InIm5 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Conc; Target: Room
    + You can see inside a room, as long as you can touch one of its walls. If the room is unlit or poorly lit, you can only see as much as you could if you were inside, but magical enhancements of your senses do apply. You may change your viewpoint within the room throughout the duration of the spell.
    + Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Room
    + [ArM5:144]
+ *Brushstrokes Revealed* InIm10 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Ring; Target: Circle
    + This spell makes the species cast by an object within the circle more vivid, so that the magus can see tiny details that are otherwise invisible. This spell has traditionally been used to investigate the physical construction of artworks, but nature-oriented Jerbiton magi have recently begun using it to investigate the handiwork of God, by examining the tiny structures of creation.
    + Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Ring
    + [HoH:S:65]
+ *Palm of Seeing (Sun duration)* InIm20 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Diam; Target: Vision
    + The caster can see from the perspective of the target. This spell must Penetrate in order to sense creatures with Magic Resistance.  Ariane has learned this spell to cast down an Intangible Tunnel.
    + Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +4 Vision
    + [TtA:80]
+ *Eyes of the Eagle (touch)* InIm30 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Vision
    + You see distant things clearly. No matter how far away something is, you can make out details as if it were only a foot or so from you. Things do not all appear to be a foot away; you can simply make out details as well as if they were. You can still judge distance accurately; in fact, more accurately than normal, to within an inch or so at a distance of several miles, since you can see as clearly as if you were judging distance a foot away.
    + Base 3, +2 Sun, +4 Vision
    + Custom variant [ArM5:145]
+ *Aura of Ennobled Presence* MuIm10 (37)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Ind
    + The target appears more forceful, authoritative, and believable.  Numerous subtle changes in appearance bring about this change, including a slight supernatural illumination of the face, a more erect posture, and a louder and smoother voice. The character gets a +3 on rolls to influence, lead, or convince others.
    + Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun
    + [ArM5:145]

    + Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun

+ *Sight of the Warm Surface* MuIm15 (37)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Conc; Target: Vision
    + Although Imaginem magic cannot create heat, warm surfaces emit species, which humans can sense through touch. This spell transforms those into species that the eye responds to. How the warmth is seen varies by magus.
    + Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +4 Vision
    + [HoH:S:65]
+ *Ogre's Stench* MuIm25 (37)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Sun; Target: Group
    + You change the targets’ smell (up to 100 people) in such a disgusting and awful way that they and every person near them must make Stamina rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 or act with a –3 penalty to all rolls. If they botch, they throw up.

+ *Image from the Wizard Torn* ReIm30 (43)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Req. In
    + Range: Per; Duration: Conc; Target: Ind
    + Your image separates from your body and moves as you do. It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. You must make an Int + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an Arcane Connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located. As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location.  The image is your image, so while you may move it in space you may not have it sit down if you are standing. Further, it appears as if illuminated by whatever light is falling on you, no matter what the level of illumination is at the image.

+ *By His Works* CrMe5 (38)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Per; Duration: Conc; Target: Ind
    + Refreshes a specific memory within the mind of the caster; as long as some fragment of it remains, this spell will restore it. Once refreshed, the caster can hold the perfected memory as long he concentrates. Studying the memory effectively creates a new one which does not fade when the spell expires. This spell was created to allow Quaesitors to perfectly recall spell sigils they encounter. The spell can be used to recall other details of a brief event, like faces or voices. This spell is often used to double- check identification.
    + Base 4, +1 Concentration

+ *Sight of Conflicting Motives* InMe15 (35)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Eye; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + You can detect the conflicting motives behind one target’s actions.  Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto or Rego spell, since it is usually easier to change a target’s emotions after you’ve sensed them than it is to create emotions.
    + Base 10, +1 Eye

+ *Posing the Silent Question* InMe20 (35)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Eye; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of “What would you do if . . . ?” often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she makes a Magic Resistance roll.

+ *Trust of the Childlike Faith* PeMe10 (29)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Diam; Target: Ind
    + The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell. An Intelligence stress roll of 6+ is allowed to resist. Truly incredible lies allow easier resistance rolls.

+ *Miner's Keen Eye (touch)* InTe25 (27)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Penetration
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Conc; Target: Vision
    + The target can see any one type of mineral (gold, diamond, sand), specified at the time of casting, through up to 3 paces of intervening material. You have a good idea of how much is there and how pure it is, if appropriate.

    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Str
    + A single stone structure, such as a castle keep or manor house, crumbles to dust and small pebbles. Anyone inside at the time takes +10 damage from falling and having stones land on them, possibly more if the structure is particularly large.

    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + Shatters a barrier of metal or stone up to one foot thick. Those within one pace of the barrier, on the opposite side from you, take +10 Damage. Alchemically refined and magical metals may be able to withstand this spell.
    + Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 size, +1 Rego to fling the fragments away

+ *Scales of Magical Weight* InVi5 (30)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Touch; Duration: Mom; Target: Ind
    + When casting this spell, you typically hold your hands straight out from your body, place a known amount of Vim vis in your left hand (usually one pawn), and then place an unknown amount of vis in your right hand. After casting the spell, you may sense how heavy the unknown vis is in relation to the known, determining the number of pawns present. If you cast the spell without anything to measure the unknown vis against, you only have a very general idea of how valuable it is. The spell cannot be used to determine the amount of raw vis invested in an enchanted item.

    + This spell dispels the Parma Magica of the target. The target’s Parma Magica Score must be less than (25 + stress die) divided by 5. The target can, of course, recast his Parma Magica in subsequent rounds, but the target may not notice that his Parma Magic has been dispelled until it is too late. Obviously, this spell is only really useful for attacking other magi. Thus, some tribunals may view magi who are known to have invented this spell with suspicion. On the other hand, there are legitimate reasons for knowing this spell — prosecuting Wizard’s War and hunting Marched magi are entirely legal and uncontroversial pursuits. Like all spells, this spell must Penetrate to be effective. Higher-level versions of this are possible for attacking targets with greater Parma Magica scores. Note that this spell uses the Perdo Vim guideline, which dispels magic effects of a specific type (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 160). Parma Magica is an example of a magical effect of a specific type, which all Hermetic magi are familiar with. This is why Wind of Mundane Silence (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161), which dispels all magical effects is effective against Parma Magica. This spell does not dispel Magic Resistance generated via other sources, nor is this spell effective against any other sorts of magic.

    + This spells opens a magical tunnel between the caster and the target.  Spells cast through this tunnel can be up to the level of this spell.  Unlike the Opening the Intangible Tunnel spell, the caster does not need to maintain concentration on this spell; this spell has duration of Diameter. This has advantages (the caster doesn’t need to maintain concentration) and disadvantages (the tunnel cannot be swiftly closed by ceasing to concentrate).  Note that, despite the name of this spell, a Diameter duration spell actually lasts for two minutes.

+ *Opening the Intangible Tunnel* ReVi20 (30)
    + Mastery: 1 (0xp) Quiet Casting
    + Range: Arc; Duration: Conc; Target: Ind
    + You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target — you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see. Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast other spells. A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the tunneling spell. If the target of the spell has Magic Resistance, you must penetrate that resistance to open the tunnel. Spells cast through the tunnel must also penetrate Magic Resistance normally.
